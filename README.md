importing all gui packages

extending superclass jframe to be called in subframe calculator and implementing action-listener so that action will be placed when a button is clicked

variables - label,textfield,button,spinner,slider

constructor

variable for the position to be determined later in the code

set title

specifing all values of spinner and slider
Create the new J... for each variable and font and color
For the buttons add them to the action listener so that method knows what to respond to
set position for each variable, use variable ^ at 5 for this
override is used at the end of constructor closing, this is that the method is overriding the parent class
Create the action event method 
Call all nessccary variables from constructor and convert integers to int using string conversion
call jButton as an object so it can be used multiple times since we have multiple buttons
do if for each button - for division if the number is being divided by zero than a pop up message saying it cannot will come up
Lastly create a main method, call calculator as an object so that a frame can be made from it
add ending code needed for the gui to show up
